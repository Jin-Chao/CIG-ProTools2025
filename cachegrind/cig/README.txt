cig_generator.in reads a CU output file generated by a CIG enhanced Cachegrind simulator and constructs a Cache Interaction Graph (CIG).

The graph is built using NetworkX and visualized with Matplotlib.

Using plot.show(), the graph can be displayed in one of three modes:

   1. In a standalone window

   2. Saved as a PDF file

   3. Rendered interactively in a Jupyter Notebook environment
