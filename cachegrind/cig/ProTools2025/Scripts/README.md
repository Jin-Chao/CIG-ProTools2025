## Directory Structure

### 1) `experiments/`
This directory contains scripts that automate the execution of performance and simulation experiments.

- `cig_cachesim.in`  
  Runs CIG simulations on all applications, including **Simple**, **Himeno**, **IRSmk**, and **PolyBench Correlation**.

- `perf_himeno.in`  
  Measures the performance of the Himeno application.

- `perf_slowdown.in`  
  Evaluates the performance overhead introduced by using CIG Cachegrind.

---

### 2) `parsers/`
This directory contains scripts that process the outputs generated by CIG simulations and automation scripts.

- `figures.sh`  
  Invokes `cig_generator.in` on simulation results generated by `cig_cachesim.in`  
  to produce Figures 4–11 and 12–14 as presented in the paper.

- `plot_himeno_results.in`  
  Generates Figure 12 based on results from `perf_himeno.in`.

- `slowdown_analysis.in`  
  Produces Tables 4 and 5 using results from `perf_slowdown.in`.
